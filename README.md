# Climate-Change-Impact
Global warming causes alot of changes in enviornment. Researches show that globals'tempreture has increased by 1 to 2 degree each year 
and intensity of precipitation has changed in some area it has been increased and some area it has beed decreased. Recent floods and storms 
are the best examples of these environment change, every years alot of peaple affected by Flood and Storm and it cause a huge amount of cost to the society. 
there are lots of studies to find out what are the main effective parameters on these changes. researchers beleives in growing population and co2 Emisison are the main parameters 
in these changes. 
in this research data from five countries Brazil,India, United State, Australia,Netherland has been selected and selective effective parameters are flood affected and 
storm affected that counts the number of peaple injured or killed and effected by flood and storm respectly and co2 emission which shows the total co2 emission in each year on 
selected country. percentage of population growth each years and forest covarages are other selected parameters. by choosing this parameter we wanted to see how increasing
population and decreasing forest covarage will increase flood and storm events and which country are more responsible in producing co2 emission. 
these reserch will showes which country produced and emitted moreCo2 and do increasing in populationa and decreasing in forest covarage have any impacts on co2 emission?
which parameters has more imact on flood and storm impact.
